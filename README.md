## What is Thankr?

Thankr is a smart webapp to help you become happier! It lets you add simple moments that you're grateful for. From that, it uses text mining to analyze your entries by looking things like the nouns used, sentiments and word freqency. By auto classifying your entry under categories, it identifies top categories that make you happy and gives you a smart suggestion on an activity you can try today! The app will become smarter as you feed more entries and train the system. We hacked this in 12 hours for the 'Powerful Women in Tech Presents: Hack for the World Hackathon' at the Facebook Headquarters. :)
