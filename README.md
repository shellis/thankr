## What is Thankr?

Thankr is a smart webapp to help you become happier! It is a simple journal that lets you add moments that you're grateful for. From that, it uses text mining to analyze your entry to analyze the nouns used, sentiments and classifies your entry by word frequency, and gives you a smart suggestion on an activity you can try based on what made you happy. We hacked this in 12 hours for the 'Powerful Women in Tech Presents: Hack for the World Hackathon' at the Facebook Headquarters. :)
